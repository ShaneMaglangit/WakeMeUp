# WakeMeUp
Create multiple alarms from a starting to a target time automatically on your phone.

# Description
Are you a heavy sleeper? Do you need multiple alarms just to wake you up? Then this is the right application for you. This let's you create several alarms automatically. 

You can set when your alarms will start and when it will end. You can also set the intervals between this alarm. Once you saved your preferences, alarms will automatically be created on the native alarm application within your mobile phone.

# Author's Note
I found myself manually setting up multiple alarms just to ensure that I wake up on time. I wanted to automate this task so I created this app. Basically, I can set when I want to wake up up to when I actually have to go. I also set intervals that I want between these alarms. For instance when my class starts at 11PM, I could just set alarms from 9PM to 11PM to ensure that I wake up on time. Overall, this was also another fun project that I also get to make use of.
